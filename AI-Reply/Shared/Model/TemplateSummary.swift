/// `ReplyConfiguration.initial`, i.e. the four default built-ins, because the
/// real configuration is a file read that must not happen on the main thread
/// during appearance. A user who renamed Client, hid Work or added Supplier
/// therefore saw the wrong chips for one frame and then a visible swap.
///
/// The fix is not to read the file sooner. It is to keep a summary small enough
/// that reading it synchronously is free: identifiers, the three localized
/// names, and order. No instructions, no business context, no rules, no profile
/// text - none of which the row needs, and all of which the full configuration
/// still carries for the request that generation actually makes.
