/**
 * Persistence for the profile and templates.
 *
 * WHY A JSON FILE AND NOT Room. The keyboard has to read this, and it has to do
 * so without paying database-stack setup every time it appears inside WhatsApp.
 * The whole configuration is a few kilobytes, written when a settings screen
 * closes and read when the keyboard appears. A database would add a dependency,
 * a migration surface and a startup cost to solve a problem this app does not
 * have. The iOS project reaches the same conclusion about Core Data, for the
 * same reasons.
 *
 * WHY NOT SharedPreferences. Preferences are for flags. A structured document
 * belongs in a file; [kz.yerek.aireply.data.settings.SettingsStore] keeps only
 * the small values the first keyboard frame needs.
 *
 * Thread safety: every entry point is `@Synchronized`, and the cache is
 * invalidated by the file's own modification time rather than by trusting that
 * this process is the only writer.
