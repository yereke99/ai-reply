/**
 * Colour palette for the keyboard.
 *
 * Every value is the exact RGB the iOS `KeyboardTheme` uses, so the two
 * keyboards are the same object in two places rather than two designs that
 * happen to share a name. No platform asset is used on either side.
 *
 * HOW DARK IS DECIDED. On iOS the host app declares what it wants through
 * `UITextDocumentProxy.keyboardAppearance`, and Telegram, WhatsApp and
 * Instagram all set it. Android has no equivalent: an `EditorInfo` carries no
 * appearance hint, and an IME window is not inside the host's theme. So the
 * honest signals here are the system's own dark mode and the user's explicit
 * override in AI Reply's settings — which is what [resolve] uses, in that
 * order of specificity.
